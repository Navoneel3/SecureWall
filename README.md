Cloud-Based Hybrid Intrusion Detection System
Signature and Machine Learning-based Anomaly Detection
📘 Overview

This project implements a Hybrid Intrusion Detection System (IDS) that combines signature-based detection with machine learning-based anomaly detection to enhance network security.
It efficiently identifies known attacks using pre-defined signatures and detects unknown or zero-day attacks using trained ML models.
The system is designed for cloud environments, ensuring scalability, adaptability, and real-time threat monitoring.
Objectives

Detect both known (signature-based) and unknown (anomaly-based) intrusions.

Improve detection accuracy while reducing false positives.

Enable real-time analysis and scalable deployment in cloud infrastructure.

Provide visual insights and logging for detected attacks.
